# Shadow
Used to blur part of a conversation downloaded from whatsapp

## Usage
Go to https://pachomdq.github.io/shadow/shadow.html
You can import a chat text from whatsapp app and define a range of time. Then you can choose who is the owner of the chat so the conversation can be formatted correctly.

## Security
When the file is loaded a hash is calculated so you can check the integrity of the original conversation. All the code is in javascript so it's visible for anyone to check its behavior. The hash can be changed from MD5, to SHA-1 and SHA-256 just by click in it.

## Limitations
This version only accepts text-only exports. In the future, the ability to include multimedia files and their respective hashes will be added.
