# Shadow
Used to blur part of a conversation downloaded from whatsapp

## Usage
Go to [https://pachomdq.github.io/shadow/shadow.html]
You can import a chat text from whatsapp app and define a range of time. Then you can choose who is the owner of the chat so the conversation can be formatted correctly.

## Security
When the file is loaded a hash is calculated so you can check the integrity of the original conversation. All the code is in javascript so it's visible for anyone to check its behavior. The hash can be changed from MD5, to SHA-1 and SHA-256 just by click in it.

## Limitations
This version supports the possibility of uploading JPG image files as they come by default in whatsapp conversations. For this you must use the second input box where multiple JPG files are allowed to be loaded.
